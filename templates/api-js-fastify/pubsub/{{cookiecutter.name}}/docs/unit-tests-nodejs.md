# **Unit Testing**

To integrate unit test in the application, the Jest framework is recommended.
[See docs here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) 

* Tests can be found in `tests` folder. An `example.test.js` has been implemented.
* To create new test, in the tests' folder, create `{test_name}.test.js` Please note the `test.js` extension.

To run tests, in the root folder of the application

        yarn or npm run test

To watch tests (This allows jest to automatically watch and reload test changes)

        yarn or npm run test:watch
