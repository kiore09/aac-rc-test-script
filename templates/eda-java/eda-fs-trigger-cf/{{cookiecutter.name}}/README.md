# EDA Solution 
**Using Cloud Function, Firestore, PubSub, and Microservices on GKE**

**Event Driven Architecture** - This sample solution demonstrates a typical EDA process where a Publisher microservice creates a documet in Firestore collection, the Cloud Function will be triggered and publish the document reference to a PubSub Topic, the Consumer (i.e. Subscriber) microservice subscribing to the Topic receives a message including the document reference and updates the document in Firestore.

## The GCP services implemented as part of this solution:

**Firestore** - NoSQL Document Database. You can find additional details about GCP Firestore [here.](https://cloud.google.com/firestore)

**Cloud Functions** - Allows you to run your code in the cloud with no servers or containers to manage. You can find additional details about cloud functions [here.](https://cloud.google.com/functions#section-9)

**Firestore Triggers** - Trigger the Cloud Function when a file is created in a Firestore Collection. You can find additional details about Firestore Triggers [here.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events)

**PubSub** - Allows services to communicate asynchronously, using a publisher and subscriber pattern. You can find additional details about PubSub [here.](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)

## Prerequisite

Before you begin, make sure that you have access to a GCP Project where you would be able to connect to and test your applications. If you need to request for a new GCP project, follow the instruction [here.](https://onboard.cloudapps.telus.com/onboard/home)

In order to test the Cloud Function, teams must ensure that the Firestore service is enabled in your GCP project and a document collection has been created.

Sample Terraform scripts for enabling Firestore and creating a sample collection: [firestore-{{ cookiecutter.name }}.tf](terraform/firestore-{{ cookiecutter.name }}.tf), and creating a PubSub Topic: [pubsub-{{ cookiecutter.name }}.tf](terraform/pubsub-{{ cookiecutter.name }}.tf) for the demo is provided in the terraform folder.

Follow the instructions provided [here.](https://simplify.telus.com/docs/developer-docs/docs/topics/applying-terraform-configuration-in-gcp-6e4wBLR5Je9aP5Vd8y70vA.md) to apply the Terraform scripts to your project.


## Testing the Cloud Function Locally

The `function-maven-plugin` in the [pom.xml](./pom.xml) provides the `mvn function:run` command, which runs your Cloud Function locally on port `8080` for testing. Make sure you
have set all required environment variables using `export ENV_VAR_1=value` commands before running the function. Then in the directory containing your `pom.xml` file, run:

```
  mvn clean package
  mvn function:run
```

You can then trigger your function using a `curl` command in a separate terminal [as documented in this guide](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/cloud-firestore-1st-gen).

For example, suppose a document with ID `YOUR_DOC_ID` is created in the collection `YOUR_COLLECTION` of the `(default)` Firestore instance in the project `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`.
Also suppose the document has the following fields:
```
  user: "Some Person"
  last_login: "2024-05-30T21:20:10.581Z"
  payload: "This is some string data"
```
Then the following `curl` command simulates the event fired from Firestore:
```
  curl localhost:8080 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ce-id: 123451234512345" \
  -H "ce-specversion: 1.0" \
  -H "ce-time: 2020-01-02T12:34:56.789Z" \
  -H "ce-type: google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.created" \
  -H "ce-source: //firestore.googleapis.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)" \
  -d '{
        "oldValue":{},
        "updateMask":{},
        "value":{
          "createTime":"2024-05-30T21:20:46.380943Z",
          "fields":{
            "user":{
              "stringValue":"Some Person"
            },
            "last_login":{
              "timestampValue":"2024-05-30T21:20:10.581Z"
            },
            "payload":{
              "stringValue":"This is some string data"
            }
          },
          "name":"projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)/documents/YOUR_COLLECTION/YOUR_DOC_ID",
          "updateTime":"2024-05-30T21:20:46.380943Z"
        }
      }'
```


## Deploying the Cloud Function Manually

To deploy the function manually, you will only need to create a build trigger for this repository. Cloud Build will then read [cloudbuild.yaml](cloudbuild.yaml) and
deploy the function accordingly.

**Before you get started:**
- Make sure Firestore is enabled and the sample collection is created.
- Make sure that the PubSub Topic is created in your GCP project.
- Check that the firestore collection name for `_FIRESTORE_COLLECTION` and `_EDA_TOPIC` are correct in [cloudbuild.yaml](cloudbuild.yaml).
- Make note of the `_FUNCTION_TITLE`, your function will be created with that name in the GCP console.
- Check that the Cloud Build and Cloud Function APIs are enabled for your GCP project.

To create a new build trigger, log in to your GCP console and got to **Navigation Menu > Cloud Build > Triggers**.

![alt text](docs/triggerNav.jpg)

Select **Create Trigger** at the top of the page to navigate to the trigger creation form. From there, fill out the following required fields:
- The name of your build trigger
- The region for the trigger (select **global** for simplicity's sake)
- The source repository to be used from the drop down menu. If this is the first time you've connected a repository, you will need to:
  - Click **Connect New Repository** which will open a new panel on the right
  - Select **GitHub (Cloud Build GitHub App)** as the source, and continue with authentication. The authentication process may take upwards of 5 minutes to complete
  - Select your repository from the drop down menu and click **Connect**

Once the repository is selected, the branch name should be auto-filled. Leave all other inputs to their default values and click **Create** at the bottom of the form.

![alt text](docs/triggerCreate.jpg)

Note that the trigger does not run immediately after its creation - you can push a commit to your connected repository to automatically trigger the deployment. Alternatively,
you can click the **Run** button on your new trigger to deploy the function manually.

![alt text](docs/triggerRun.jpg)

The function may take a couple of minutes to deploy, you can check the progress on the Cloud Build Dashboard. Once complete, go to **Navigation Menu > Cloud Functions** and
check that your function has been deployed correctly (its name should be the value of `_FUNCTION_TITLE` in [cloudbuild.yaml](cloudbuild.yaml).)

## Adding Collaborators and Working Together
The owner of this repository can add additional admins or collaborators (documentation on access to repositories can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization).)

You may currently not have the ability to push code to your `main` branch without additional reviewers. To further customize the rules governing how code is pushed to your branches, [edit your branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).

We highly recommend that you add an additional reviewer/approver; however, technically as an admin and repo creator, you can bypass by checking the checkbox "*Merge without waiting for requirements to be met*"
