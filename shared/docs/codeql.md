# **CodeQL** 

CodeQL is the analysis engine used to scan and analyze code to find security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other errors. It then automatically uploads the results to GitHub so they can be displayed in the repository's security tab. CodeQL runs an extensible set of queries, which have been developed by the community and the GitHub Security Lab to find common vulnerabilities in your code.

The CodeQL feature is seamlessly integrated into all sample applications generated by the Software Template during the setup process using GitHub workflows with the attributes defined in the `cookiecutter.yaml` file. The CodeQL configuration, located in the `codeql.yaml` file, can be easily customized to suit your specific requirements. The `codeql.yaml` file is automatically placed in the `.github/workflows` folder of each generated sample application.

The CodeQL workflow is then automatically triggered when a commit or Pull Request is created against the `main` branch and the results are displayed in the repository's security tab under `Code scanning`.
