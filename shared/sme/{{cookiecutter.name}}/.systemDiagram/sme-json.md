# **System Diagram JSON**

Included with this template is a [JSON file](./systemDiagram.json) for generating a system diagram for your project. You can update this JSON file using the System Meta Editor interface.
(while on VPN):

https://system-meta-editor.cloudapps.telus.com/loading/{{ cookiecutter.name }}

Once the form has been updated and the diagram is generated, you can enter the name of
your Github Repo into the System Meta Editor tool and it will create a pull request against your repo. This pull
request will contain the generated diagram and any updates you made to the JSON file.
